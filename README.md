# WOWCAM
A simple World of Warcraft addon manager for CurseForge addons

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Breaking News: WOWCAM has finally released! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

After nearly 1.5 years of development (and a LOT of crazy coding), i can finally say:

_"All bad things must come to an end!"_

---

#### Under construction

The new WOWCAM tool ("_**W**orld **o**f **W**arcraft **C**urse **A**ddon **M**anager_") evolves here...

#### Whaaat?

WOWCAM will be the official next generation [WADM](https://github.com/MBODM/WADM) successor! To achieve this goal it combines [WADH](https://github.com/MBODM/WADH) and [WAUZ](https://github.com/MBODM/WAUZ) into a single and simple-to-use tool.

Promises:
- It will make WoW addon mangement great again!
- It will include an "unzip-only" fallback mode (since https://curseforge.com could change again).
- It will **not** be that "ugly as f**k Windows default style" and it **will** have a dark theme!
- It will have some app update mechanism.

#### Update 04/2024

I decided against an "unzip-only" fallback mode, for the following reasons:
- An "operating mode" will make a LOT of things way more complex (config handling, adaptive UI, etc.) and will bloat the source code in various locations a lot.
- Since a "download-only" mode makes not much sense, it's just the "unzip-only" mode.
- For pure unzipping, [WAUZ](https://github.com/MBODM/WAUZ) is still there. And it fullfills that role way more precise.
- It allows me to focus more on the core features, with my sparse time.
- This doesn't mean there will be **never** such an "unzip-only" fallback mechanism.

#### In short:

Work in progress...

#### Have fun.
