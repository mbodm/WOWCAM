# WOWCAM
A simple World of Warcraft addon manager for CurseForge addons

#### Under construction

The new WOWCAM tool ("_**W**orld **o**f **W**arcraft **C**urse **A**ddon **M**anager_") evolves here...

#### Whaaat?

WOWCAM will be the official next generation [WADM](https://github.com/MBODM/WADM) successor! To achieve this goal it combines [WADH](https://github.com/MBODM/WADH) and [WAUZ](https://github.com/MBODM/WAUZ) into a single and simple-to-use tool.

Promises:
- It will make WoW addon mangement great again!
- It will include an "unzip-only" fallback mode (since https://curseforge.com could change again).
- It will **not** be that "Windows default style" ugly as f**k and it **will** have a dark theme!

#### Update 04/2024

I decided against an "unzip-only" fallback mode, for the following reasons:
- An "operating mode" will make a LOT of things way more complex (config handling, adaptive UI, etc.) and will bloat the source code in various locations a lot.
- Since a "download-only" mode makes not much sense, it's just the "unzip-only" mode.
- For pure unzipping [WAUZ](https://github.com/MBODM/WAUZ) is still there, which fullfills such requirements way more precise.

#### In short:

Work in progress...

#### Have fun.
